                    <p>
                        It is with exceptional fulfilment and
                        gratification that I welcome you to Rural Climate 
                        Action (RCA), an initiative on the mission to
                        reduce greenhouse gas emissions, prepare and 
                        respond to the effects of climate change through 
                        locally based solutions that prepare communities to
                        adjusting to the current and future effects of 
                        climate change. We aim to support science based 
                        decision–making, promoting practices that are 
                        good for the environment, helping communities 
                        adapt to climate change, enhance communities’ 
                        abilities to withstand climate change effects while 
                        moving to renewable energies and aiming to 
                        ensure farmers in rural communities adopt to
                        climate smart agriculture for improved food 
                        security and reducing food wastage

                    <p>
                        As Rural Climate Action (RCA), we aim to engage 
                        women, men, girls and boys in environmental 
                        conservation and climate resilience and adaptation
                        activities. Climate change is not gender neutral and it 
                        can amplify existing inequalities of these groups if not 
                        properly involved in these interventions.

                        As a founder and a visionary, I aspire to join hands with 
                        everyone who beliefs on locally led climate solutions to 
                        address the effects of climate change. Despite of the many 
                        challenges we are faced with as a not-for-profit 
                        organization, the vision still remains clear in sight and we
                        continuously do our best to make sure these
                        underprivileged communities still get support to adapt 
                        and be resilient.

                        I welcome you on this journey and look forward to your

                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <P>
                    Rural Climate Action is a national Non-Governmental 
                    Organization (NGO) registered in Kenya with reg. no. 
                    NGO-VYF25D, Our headquarters is currently located in 
                    Lodwar, Turkana County. We are committed to 
                    supporting vulnerable communities, particularly 
                    children, women, people living with disability, the 
                    elderly and the most marginalized to adapt to the 
                    impacts of climate change. Our first intended project is 
                    to address nutritional diet in primary and secondary 
                    schools in Turkana, Isiolo and west Pokot through 
                    establishment of school orchards. Fruit trees are a 
                    logical, and sweet, extension of school gardens. Not 
                    only can they provide an abundant source of nutrient-
                    rich food for students and cafeterias, they can also stand 
                    for years as the centerpiece of a living ecology 
                    classroom. We aim to support over 50 schools between 
                    2025 and 2030.
                </P>
